        <p><span class="first-character sc">1</span>Wickramabahu National College traces its origins back to January 3, 1946, when it was founded as Wallahagoda Central College. At the time, the school operated with only four teachers and 55 students, holding classes in the peaceful environment of the Niyangampaya Raja Maha Viharaya Buddhist temple. This humble beginning marked the start of what would grow into a prominent educational institution in Sri Lanka.

            In 1951, the school took a significant step forward when the then Prime Minister, D. S. Senanayake, laid the foundation stone for a permanent school building. This construction was completed in 1954, giving the college a dedicated space for academic and administrative activities. Following this development, the school was renamed Gampola Central College to reflect its growing status and central role in regional education.
            
            Further changes came in 1960, when the Sri Lankan government implemented nationwide education reforms. As part of this transformation, the institution became a boys-only school and was officially renamed Wickramabahu Central College. Over the years, the school has continued to evolve, eventually gaining national school status and expanding its academic and infrastructural offerings while maintaining a deep connection to its historical roots. </div>
